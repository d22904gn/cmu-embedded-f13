1. Entry point: 0x82ac
2. _init
3. -D (Big d) disassembles all sections, not just sections with code
   (i.e. sections with code are: .init, .plt, .text, .fini since they are
    marked executable.) 
4. The interpretation is incorrect; .rodata contains read-only constants
   in the program, such as the strings passed to printf(). Data in this
   section is not meant to be interpreted as instructions; they are 
   hex representations of ASCII characters.
