Our lab was originally submitted on 25 Oct, 11:27 PM. However, a new post (@219)
on piazza appeared that made the requirements for echo and rot13 clearer. Our
old echo and rot13 only processed the arguments and didn't read from stdin, but
the requirements for those 2 programs was that it had to process the arguments
and then read in from stdin. As the requirements were ambiguous in the handout,
we decided (As advised by the TA on piazza) that we should submit the corrected
echo and rot13, but put in a readme documenting why our latest submission was
submitted past friday. 

We have left the original submission as original-lab2-group-02-part2.tar.gz.
You can see from the last modified date that the submitted date was on friday.

Our submission with the corrected rot13 and echo files is named
lab2-group-02-part2.tar.gz.

Thanks for reading!
