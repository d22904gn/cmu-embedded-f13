                                    @ mode by setting mode bits to 110 10000
    msr     cpsr_c, r2              @ Change to user mode.

    @ Setup a full descending user mode stack (with the stack top at 0xa3000000)
    ldr     sp, =0xa3000000

    @ Push U-Bootâ€™s argc & argv on the user stack.
    @ Registers r0 and r1 contain the arguments to this function, which are
    @ U-Boot's argc and argv values respectively.
    push    {r0,r1}

    @ Jump to a loaded user program at address 0xa2000000.
    mov     lr, pc
    ldr     pc, =0xa2000000
    
    @ Exit via syscall when user returns. Easier to clean up code this way since
    @ all exit procedures are stored in the exit syscall.
